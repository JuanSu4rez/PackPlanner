# PackPlanner
This is a coding challenge meant to be completed in C#

To test it, an "Input.txt" file can be placed in a folder called "InputFiles" located in the root folder of the generated .exe file.

These parameters (the names for the folder and file) can be found and modified in the PackPlannerMain class.
